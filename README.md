## 📌 Overview

E-Mack is a data analysis system developed using pure Python to process e-commerce product data stored in a CSV file.

The project manually implements all logic for reading, processing, analyzing, and generating reports — without using external libraries such as pandas or data visualization frameworks.

---

## 🧠 Problem Context

E-commerce companies need to analyze product data to better understand:

- Product distribution by category
- Percentage of best-selling products
- Most expensive and least expensive products
- Sales activity within a given period

This project simulates a real-world scenario by implementing the full analytical workflow using only core Python features.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (standard library only)
- Manual CSV file parsing
- Data structures (lists and dictionaries)
- Dynamic HTML generation
- Embedded CSS styling

---

## ⚙️ Features

✔ Manual CSV file reading and parsing  
✔ Product count by category  
✔ Percentage calculation per category  
✔ Best-seller proportion analysis  
✔ Top 10 most expensive products  
✔ Top 10 least expensive products  
✔ Automatic HTML report generation  
✔ Interactive terminal menu

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The system is organized into functions responsible for:

- Data loading
- Data aggregation and processing
- Custom sorting operations
- HTML report generation
- Terminal-based user interaction

All analytical logic was implemented manually to demonstrate strong understanding of data manipulation fundamentals.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Place the `emack.csv` file in the same directory as the project.
2. Run:

   python main.py

3. Select the desired option from the menu.

The system will automatically generate HTML reports based on the selected analysis.
